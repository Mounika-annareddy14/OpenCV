# OpenCV Mini-Project

This mini-project demonstrates **video frame processing, ROI selection, annotations, and basic computer vision operations using OpenCV**.

---

## 🔹 Project Overview

- This project works on a sample video (Google Chrome opening video).  
- It processes each frame to display frame properties, allows **ROI (Region of Interest) selection using mouse clicks**, and performs annotations.  
- Main features include:
  - Drawing rectangles and circles on the selected ROI
  - Converting ROI to grayscale
  - Bitwise operations on ROI
  - Saving individual frames
  - Saving the processed output video

## Instructions while running:

Click twice on the video frame to select the ROI.

Press r to reset ROI selection.

Press q to quit the video.

Frames will be saved automatically in the frames folder, and the output video will be saved as output_video.mp4.
